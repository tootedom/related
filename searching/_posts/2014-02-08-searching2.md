The search functionality allows you to filter the result based on a property of the indexed document.  For example, from the initial POST there was 4 related items:

    {
       "channel":"de",
       "site":"amazon",
       "items":[
          {
             "id":"1",
             "type":"map"
          },
          {
             "id":"2",
             "type":"compass"
          },
          {
             "id":"3",
             "type":"torch"
          },
          {
             "id":"4",
             "type":"torch",
             "channel":"uk"
          }
       ]
    }'

* 3 of those had the property: `channel: de`
* 1 of those had the property: `channel: uk`

The item that had overridden the `channel` property was the following (The document with id 4):

    {
        "id": "4" ,
        "date": "2013-12-24T17:44:41.943Z",
        "related-with": [ "1","2","3"],
        "type": "torch",
        "site": "amazon",
        "channel": "uk"
    }

In the above, there are 3 extra elements that can be searched on:

* `type`
* `site`
* `channel`

As a result you can say.  Give me the frequently related products that are mostly purchased with product **1**, filtering the results to return only that of "tourches", i.e. type=torch:

    curl -v -N http://10.0.1.29:8080/searching/frequentlyrelatedto/1?type=torch

The result is:

    {
        "response_time": "11", 
        "results": [
            {
                "frequency": "1", 
                "id": "4"
            }, 
            {
                "frequency": "1", 
                "id": "3"
            }
        ], 
        "size": "2", 
        "storage_response_time": "2"
    }

You can go further and search for torches, just in `channel:uk`, which is:

    curl -v -N "http://localhost:8080/searching/frequentlyrelatedto/1?type=torch&channel=uk"


Handy little command line json formatter is than of python.  Try:
    
    curl -v -N "http://localhost:8080/searching/frequentlyrelatedto/1?type=torch&channel=uk"  | python -mjson.tool

Which will result in just the one related item:

    {
        "response_time": 3, 
        "results": [
            {
                "frequency": "1", 
                "id": "4"
            }
        ], 
        "size": "1", 
        "storage_response_time": 1
    }

Currently the search result just returns the id's of the related items, and the frequency by which it was related with the searched for item it.   It *DOES NOT* return the matching document's information.  

The reason behind not returning the matching documents source, is that there could be literally hundreds of matching documents.  An example would be the dvd `The Raid`.  This could be bought many many times, and with a number of other items; and often with the same related item many times.  

For the below related item POSTs, the dvd `The Raid`, is associated with `Enter the dragon` and `kick boxer`.  It is associated with `kick boxer` twice, and therefore `kick boxer` is the most frequently related item.  

In the backend (elasticsearch), there are two actual physical documents that represent `kick boxer`.  If we are to return the matching documents for the `most frequently related`, we have to return the source of both `kick boxer` documents.  Expanding this further you could quite easily have am item related to another item 100's of times; which would mean 100's of matching documents.  It is for this reason the content of that matches are not returned.
