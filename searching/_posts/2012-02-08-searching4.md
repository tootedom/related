By default the indexes that are searched in elasticsearch are any index that have a name starting with `**relateditems-**`.  In other words a wild card search across all dated indexes starting with **relateditems-**

The prefix of the index name is controlled by the following configuration parameter.  A hyphen `-`, will added to the end of the prefix, and any subsequent indexing will index documents into a dated index:

    -Drelated-item.storage.index.name.prefix

For example with the setting:

    -Drelated-item.storage.index.name.prefix=related

Documents will be indexed and Searching in/from indexes named: `related-YYYY-MM-DD`.

It is also possible to use an alias against which to perform searches, rather than performing a wild search search. (**note** The alias does not apply to indexing).

The below gives an example of the curl request used to set up an index in elasticsearch.  It creates an alias `related`, which is an alias for the indexes: `relateditems-2013-12-23` and `relateditems-2013-12-24`.  When `related` is used to search, the search will be performed only against those two indexes.

    curl -XPOST localhost:9200/_aliases -d '
    {
        "actions": [
            { "add": {"alias": "related", "index": "relateditems-2013-12-23"} },
            { "add": { "alias": "related","index": "relateditems-2013-12-24"} }
        ]
    }'

To tell the Search Web Application to use that alias, instead of the wildcard index search, you specify the alias name using the following parameter:

    -Drelated-item.storage.index.name.alias=related
